Software Development Project
Queueline Management System


Luca Marigo (Marketing & Sales Director), and Margherita Mongo (PR Specialist) have contacted ... on behalf of Gardaland, Garda, Italy.

They said they are currently in the process of piloting a new queueline management system on their pre-existing attraction ‘Shaman’; a Vekoma MK-1200 that has been operating at the park since 1985. They have decided to pilot the new system on this ride as it will have minimal impact to the existing ride operations, however it does have the additional challenge of dealing with an older PLC & control board, which is planned to be integrated into the overall system.

The planned system has three main functionalities:
Output the current queue time, by monitoring how many guests have entered the queue and dispatched on the ride.
Provide guests the option to exclusively queue for the front row, or elsewhere on the coaster train through a turnstile and monitor system.
The turnstiles should only allow the correct number of guests to enter the ride platform. In most circumstances this will be 2 passengers on the front and 26 passengers on other rows.
The monitors will be located above the turnstiles and will display the number of guests that are able to pass through, the number displayed will countdown in real-time.
Communicate with the pre-existing PLC that operates the rollercoasters operations.

Your task is to develop a software-based prototype that simulates this system. You could consider using a micro-controller to simulate inputs and outputs (although this is not necessary).
